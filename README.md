# Binary Classification (Benign vs. Malignant) and 5-Class Classification (Stages 1-5) of Lung Cancer Using AI on CT Images
# Abstract
This report presents an approach to a classification problem aimed at diagnosing lung cancer using CT images. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for 18% of total cancer fatalities in 2020. Due to its frequent late-stage diagnosis, survival rates remain low. To address this, screening programs have been developed, increasing the demand for accurate malignant nodule detection.
